<h3> Gunnar Sorensen<br>Quality Engineer slalom_build<br>Udemy Typscript Course</h3>

This is my repo for the bench time directly out of the QE academy. I am hoping to have functional projects written in TypeScript by the end of this bench.
I am excited to dive into the world of TS as it seems like one of, if not the most, popular programming languages, and one that is used a lot on client projects within _Build.
